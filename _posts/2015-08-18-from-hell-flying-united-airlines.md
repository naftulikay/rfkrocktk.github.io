Never fly United Airlines.

Below lies a true tale of Murphy's law in full effect: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

At approximately 4:15 to 4:20PM PST on Tuesday, we left our house for the airport. Our flight departed at 5:59 PM. We drove over to The Park at LAX, which is where we planned on storing Charlotte Champion for the duration of the trip. Uber and similar services wanted $50 for one way service from our house to LAX, so we chose to park the car in a lot for around $60, saving around $40. It made sense at the time. We arrived at The Park at LAX at around 4:50.

It was pretty seamless, we just dropped off the car, got our bags out, and awaited the shuttle. There was a shuttle which was there unloading arriving passengers' bags, so we waited for that to be finished. The driver then hopped in the shuttle, backed out of his parking space, and started to leave. At first, we thought that he was just turning around, but he left. My wife waved at the driver to try to flag him down, but he raced out of the parking lot and we were left scratching our heads wondering what went wrong.

After speaking to someone behind the counter, he was likewise confused by why the driver just up and left. He offered to drive us himself, but we ended up waiting there from when we parked until we left for the airport for about 10 minutes.

We made it to the terminal and went to check our bags. I had already done check in earlier that day with my phone, so I hoped that this would be automated and pretty painless. I was wrong. I put in our confirmation number which I had committed to memory, and was presented with a screen which said that we were too late to check bags. We flagged down an attendant and we were told to get in the customer service line. Apparently, there is a cutoff for checking bags at 45 minutes before take off. We were literally a few minutes late for check in.

After waiting 20 minutes in line (basically guaranteeing that we wouldn't make our flight: high-five for efficiency!), we finally reached the front and the associate booked us on a later 9:30pm flight. He didn't charge us a fee luckily, and upgraded our seats to Economy Plus, which means a few more inches for our legs. All of this could have been avoided if an attendant had taken the time to look and see that we were only a couple minutes late.

We passed through security relatively quickly, surprisingly enough. We now had to wait around four more hours for our flight. It would have been horrible doing this flying solo, but this time, I was accompanied by my wife and 10-month-old daughter. We did whatever we could to cope to make it through those four hours.

Our flight was delayed. We were now told that the new take-off time would be 10:30 PM. Great. 5 hours of waiting now. We buckled down for the long-haul, trying to get our daughter to sleep and trying to relax ourselves.

Finally, we were able to board. After settling in, we were informed that we had no pilots. Estimated take-off time was now around 11:00 PM. Great. The pilots arrived and we were able to take off at around 11:20 PM. At least we were in the air, albeit arriving at around 2:30AM MST rather than 9:00PM MST, 5 hours later.

After fighting through a two-hour flight of utter hell trying to calm our daughter and get her to sleep in a new environment, we landed in Denver International Airport. It was too late in the night for the trains to be running, so we had to traverse across the airport on foot. I estimate that we had to walk at least a mile total from the plane to our bags. There was a bus that took us a large chunk of the distance, but we still had to travel pretty far on foot with our things.

The bus ride was awful and the driver was brake-happy. The bus was not large enough for all of the passengers and I did what I could to not fall over as there wasn't any rail space left over to hold onto.

We finally got to our luggage and went out to catch a shuttle to Thrifty rental car. We stood around waiting for around 15 minutes, it was now a quarter past 3 am. I called Thrifty's hotline a number of times, asking when the shuttle was coming. I was told that the customer service representative would call the Denver Thrifty and request a shuttle. As shuttles from National, Enterprise, and AVIS passed by constantly taunting us, we kept calling Thrifty asking where the shuttle was. As I was on the phone with the representative again, we saw the back end of the Thrifty bus pulling through _the wrong lane_ at the airport and we realized that because of driver error, we missed the shuttle sent to us. I asked the representative to schedule another pickup. In around 10 more minutes, the shuttle finally came. All-in-all, we spent 45-50 minutes waiting for a shuttle which was supposed to come by every 10-15 minutes.

We got to Thrifty just after 4 am. Thrifty itself had all of its lights off, so with little explanation, we were dropped off in front of Dollar Rent-a-Car. The lights were on, but there was nobody there. The doors were open and there was a half-eaten bag of Cheet-O's on the table. I called out in a loud voice several times wondering if anyone was in the building.

Finally, a lady entered the building stage left. She rudely informed us that we were lucky that our reservation wasn't cancelled outright: apparently Thrifty cancels reservations if their customers' flights are delayed past midnight. She asked where we were going. "Denver" was my answer, why in the hell does she need to know where I'm going? She asked "where?" "Would a zipcode help?" I asked, hoping I wouldn't have to give her GPS coordinates and altitude for an accurate three-dimensional location of our destination.

Nope, a zipcode wouldn't help. I sighed and gave her the address. Apparently, the reason why she was asking is to determine whether we needed a pass for the toll-roads. No, I don't want to take your toll-roads, I just want to get to my destination, thanks. After signing paperwork and paying more than we agreed on, we were out the door with the instructions to "take anything in L-4."

I had arranged for a full-size sedan, like a Nissan Altima. Finding L-4 wasn't easy at 4:30 am with a sleeping baby, carriage, and a lot of luggage, but we finally located it and the only thing there was a few SUVs. I honestly didn't care at this point, so we took a Nissan Xterra. Great, we were finally on our way to our friends' house in Denver.

We arrived at their house at around 5 am. I did my best to catch a few hours of sleep and then try to pull myself together (and not have a psychological breakdown) to work a full day remotely on my laptop.

This all happened on the way from Los Angeles to Denver. We hoped that the trip back home would be uneventful and straightforward. We were wrong.

Our return flight was scheduled to depart Denver airport at around 8:00 am. My alarm went off at 5:00am, figuring a 30 minute drive to Thrifty, a 20-30 minute shuttle delay from Thrifty to the airport, 30 minutes to get through security, having ample time left over to wait for boarding.

My flight was canceled. At least United had emailed me this information. I used their website to choose an alternate flight. I chose an 11am flight, confirmed the change, double-checked to make sure that everything worked alright, and then went back to sleep to grab as much as I could before enduring another awful travel experience. Nothing could have prepared me for how awful it was going to be.

We left the house around 8am. We made good time to Thrifty. Dropping off the car was uneventful. Catching the shuttle to the airport was straightforward this time. The security line was extremely long in Denver airport on a Sunday, but it moved quickly and they did work to expedite our process, which we were thankful for. We caught the train to our terminal and gate, and everything was straightforward.

At this point in time, we realized what United had done. We were on standby. For someone unacquainted with this horrific term, it means that you don't have a guaranteed seat on the airplane. Since United cancelled an entire flight of people trying to travel to LA from Denver, there simply wasn't room on the flight for us. We didn't have seats and waited there in vain, watching the airplane take off without us. Gathering whatever resolve we had left, we approached the customer service counter to demand in as peaceful a way possible that United get us back home.

I was offered to be put on standby at 1pm. I calmly but angrily informed the attendant that this was _completely unacceptable:_ I don't have time to wait around the airport hoping for a snowball's chance in hell that I'd get on another overbooked flight. The only flight that they could confirm for us was leaving Denver at 10:15 PM: fourteen, _fourteen_ hours after we were supposed to leave. It was all I could do to keep from screaming at this point. There were no other options, we were informed, other than standby.

They arranged for us to be put on standby for the 1pm flight (which was also overbooked) and book us _actual seats_ on the 10:15 pm flight.

As someone who avoids asking for help if at all possible, I was forced to reach out to my friend in Denver and ask him if we could crash at his place for the day. He volunteered to drive the hour (half an hour each way) to pick us up at 1pm. He agreed, with me feeling embarrassed for having to ask. It was hard to imagine that all of this pain and suffering was now being extended to our friends, all due to United Airlines' policy of treating their customers like excrement.

Our friends picked us up at 1pm and we headed back to a Jewish deli on the east side of town for some food. I forced myself to eat, though it was nearly impossible to do so while feeling so incredibly dizzy and disoriented.

Throughout the day, I kept attempting to call The Park at LAX to inform them that I'd be late, but _both_ of their numbers rang for long periods of time and I never connected with anyone. Great, now we might not be able to pickup our car that night, as it was necessary to call the hotline for an airport pickup at LAX.

I spent the rest of the day trying to do damage control on my other obligations: another friend was due to drive up to Los Angeles from San Diego to meet us for dinner. That obviously had to be cancelled. #thanksunited

I called United to demand that they do better than this. I reached a representative who was unnaturally helpful and claimed to be able to get us on a 7:00 pm flight back to Los Angeles in first class. I hoped and prayed that it was true, but as he was transferring our reservation, he apparently hung up on me. He didn't call me back. I called the hotline again and asked if they could find out who I was just speaking to. They couldn't. On top of that, the 7:00pm flight was completely full and they had no record of any attempt to rebook me. I asked if they could upgrade me to first class for the 10pm flight. They couldn't: it was full. In exasperation, I hung up the phone and we headed for our friends' house from the deli.

Our friends did the unimaginable for us and helped us out of one of the worst travel situations imaginable. They brought us back to their house and went out shopping for a few hours to give our daughter a chance to sleep.

7:00pm rolled around and we hopped in our friends car and drove back to Denver airport. I'm now pretty knowledgeable about Denver airport's layout, thanks to United forcing me to spend so much time there. We breezed through security, made it to our gate, and hoped and prayed that our flight wouldn't be delayed. I spent the time at our friends' house checking often on the flight status. Thankfully, it wasn't delayed.

My wife was awesome and handled things amazingly well, she took the baby on a walk throughout the airport while waiting for our flight so I could try and unwind and relax. I was able to catch a bit of meditation which helped enormously. In light of  my experiences with United Airlines, I made sure to speak with the lady behind the counter at the gate: "Please humor me, I've had a horrible day. Can you please confirm that we have seats aboard this aircraft and that we're _actually_ going to be in Los Angeles tonight?"

She confirmed: yes we have seats and will be flying to LAX tonight. Waiting in line to board, I received a call from The Park at LAX with them wondering where I was. I informed them that my flight was canceled and delayed and that I'd be arriving at LAX around 11:30 pm local time.

As the plane had arrived, we boarded, and after only minor delays, we took off for LA. My poor daughter had a pretty terrible time and had a fever on the flight and couldn't fall asleep for the first hour or so of the two hour flight.

When we landed in Los Angeles, things began to slowly shape up. We proceeded to baggage claim and claimed our luggage which had arrived 14 hours earlier than we. Luckily, we were immediately handed our bags at the service desk and were able to get out of the airport, something I was happy to do.

We crossed over to the area at which we were supposed to wait and call for a pickup shuttle to The Park at LAX, and as our luck seemed to have turned around, the driver was there and we boarded the shuttle. After a short drive to The Park at LAX, we picked up Charlotte Champion (my car) and drove home.

Crossing the threshold of our home at 1:30 am local time, we breathed a sigh of relief and spent the rest of Monday hiding indoors pretending it was Sunday and that all was well in the world.

I don't fear airplanes. They don't make me nervous at all. I fear companies like United Airlines who are horrible to their customers. I now fear traveling using airlines. If it were up to me, I'd never fly again. If and when I ever return to Denver, I'll most likely just drive the eleven-hundred miles by car over two days. At least in that case, I'll have a realistic amount of control of my fate and time of arrival. From my house to Denver, it's approximately a 11-14 hour drive, which is the amount of time that I spent on Sunday trying to get out of Denver under the United Airlines logo mocking me.

I fly once a year if at all possible, and as I approach that flight in less than 3 weeks, a sense of dread overcomes me, hoping that KLM treats its customers like human beings instead of refuse like United does. My experiences in the past with KLM have been stellar, but I've learned firsthand how much pain an airline company can cause.

I was sent an email which told me that United wanted to hear my feedback and "compensate" me. Oh, really? I was asked whether I'd like 3500 mileage points or a $75 voucher toward a future United flight. **How about neither!?** United, you're trying to compensate me for the torture I endured at your hands with _more torture at your hands?_ United, since you didn't give me the option to leave feedback on your website or with any of your agents (United agents tell you to go online to leave feedback, convenient that there's no form), here's an open letter to you:

> Dear United Airlines,
> You are the single worst company I have _ever_ had the misfortune of dealing with. On the same trip, twice you caused us to miss flights, something that could have easily been avoided had you cared about your customers and trained your employees to reflect that care. When you allowed us to rebook because of the cancellation, instead of reserving seats you put us on standby, offering us false hope in the guise of appearing that you cared.
>
> You did not offer to help us. Your agents were entirely unhelpful. You offered virtually no compensation for the overwhelming amount of suffering that you put us through. You should have refunded our tickets or put us in a hotel for the day, but you did not do that.
>
> Most companies want feedback from their customers. I don't care if you do or do not want feedback, I'm going to give it to you anyway. I will _never_ fly United again. Furthermore, I will do anything in my power to convince those I love and care about, and indeed all of humanity, to _never_ use your airline. How likely am I to recommend you to a friend? There is no number small enough on a scale to represent that amount. How likely am I to use United Airlines again? Never. Never again.
>
> I sincerely hope that your business collapses into the ground and that your executives have to deal with the pain and suffering of traveling with a company like yours.
>
> Cordially,
