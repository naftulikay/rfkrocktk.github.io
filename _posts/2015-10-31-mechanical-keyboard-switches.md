A while ago, I bought a [Cherry MX switch tester][switch-tester] from [WASD Keyboards][wasd-site]. As someone is
dipping his toes into the world of mechanical keyboards, I decided to include a short review here for others in a
similar position.

For those who are exceedingly new, Cherry MX switches are the _de-facto standard_ of mechanical key switches. The fact
that there are around 86 thousand people subscribed to [/r/MechanicalKeyboards][subreddit] is a testament to the size
of the community around mechanical keyboards. From gamers to hackers, people are falling in love with the way keyboards
used to be made.

I'm as of yet unconvinced, but I did buy this [Cherry MX switch tester][switch-tester] to test out the different Cherry
MX switch types.

# Types of Switches

For those unfamiliar, there are three different types of mechanical keyboard switches which you should care about:

<dl>
    <dt>Free-Motion Switches</dt>
    <dd><p>Free-motion switches just go up and down. At some point along the movement of the key, the switch is engaged.
    There is no tactile response whatsoever, the key just floats on a spring and at a certain point, the switch is
    engaged.</p>

    <p>Notable examples: the Cherry MX Red and the Cherry MX Black.</p></dd>

    <dt>Tactile Switches</dt>
    <dd><p>The tactile bit means that there's a physical response you can feel from the key as it is engaged. This
    allows you to develop a <em>feel</em> for your keyboard, knowing when exactly the switch will be engaged. This is really
    helpful if you're gaming or if you're always accidentally hitting keys; the switch will allow a little bit of
    downward motion, then resistance as a sort of "bump," and then will activate the switch and continue downward.</p>

    <p>Notable examples: the Cherry MX Brown and the Cherry MX Clear.</p></dd>

    <dt>Clicky, Tactile Switches</dt>
    <dd><p>The loud, clicky keys you're probably thinking of. Want to ruin your cubicle neighbor's day? Clicky, tactile
    keys are definitely the choice for you. Use at your own risk, defenestration may ensue.</p>

    <p>Notable examples: the Cherry MX Blue and the Cherry MX Green.</p></dd>
</dl>

## Switch Variants

Cherry MX switches usually come in what seems like "medium" and "hard mode," meaning that one switch should be what the
average user wants and the other is for those who like [RSI][rsi]. My opinion reflects this: unless you want _actual_
carpal tunnel and/or repetitive strain injury, stick with the medium mode.

One potential use for hard-mode switches is to prevent fat-fingering certain keys: if you're using a medium mode switch
and you're _still_ accidentally engaging the space bar inadvertently, consider upgrading that specific key to a
hard-mode switch.

# Free-Motion Switches: Red and Black

The Cherry MX Red and Cherry MX Black switches are free-motion, which means that they offer the same resistance through
the entire range of motion of the key. You cannot determine based on feel alone whether you've activated the switch or
not. You can estimate the amount of depth you'll have to go to in order to activate it, and you can certainly watch
your screen to see if it has been activated, but that's as good as you're going to get with free-motion switches like
the Red and Black.

## Cherry MX Red

This is your medium-mode free-motion switch. If you don't want or need tactile feedback and want a floating key on a
spring, this is your switch.

Notice how it works? The little ramp to the left of the image near the moving pin is what dictates when the switch gets
activated. It's just a straight groove, so you don't feel any bump during its activation.

## Cherry MX Black

![Cherry MX Black Action](/images/2015-10-31-mechanical-keyboard-switches/cherry-mx-black-action.gif)

This is your hard-mode free-motion switch. Do not apply unless you're The Incredible Hulk or want typing-related
injuries.

# Tactile Feedback Switches: Brown and Clear

The Cherry MX Brown and Cherry MX Clear switches are tactile feedback switches which feature a little tactile resistance
bump as the switch engages. If you're like me and accidentally triggering your <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd> keys while
going through your RSS feeds or emails, these switches will ensure that you only trigger your switches when you want to.

## Cherry MX Brown

![Cherry MX Brown Action](/images/2015-10-31-mechanical-keyboard-switches/cherry-mx-brown-action.gif)

**My personal favorite.** No clicky, and medium-mode resistance. My impression is that this type of switch is the best
all-around switch for typing and gaming. For gamers, being able to rest some pressure on the key right up to the
activation point then being able to hit that key like a hair trigger is a _huge_ selling point. For people who spend
most of their time typing, like myself, this makes typing intuitive and makes it harder to mistype.

If you take a close look to the bit near the moving pin to the left, you can see where your tactile bump comes from, the
little valley in the side of the key. This is the selling point for me, being able to depress the key _right_ up to
where it'll engage and then being able to trigger it instantly.

## Cherry MX Clear

Not sure why this isn't called the Cherry MX White, but here it is, the hard-mode tactile switch.

Again, this probably isn't what you want and will most likely give you repetitive strain injury.

# The Clickies: Blue and Green

Interested in lying to your peers about [being a hacker](https://imgur.com/t5COWJ0)? Want to annoy the hell out of your
coworkers and family members? Clicky, tactile switches are for you!

I honestly can't find any reason for owning these kind of switches other than those given above. My Apple Wireless
Keyboard makes enough noise, and it's not _designed to be noisy_ like these switches are.

## Cherry MX Blue

![Cherry MX Blue Action](/images/2015-10-31-mechanical-keyboard-switches/cherry-mx-blue-action.gif)

Medium mode annoying clicky switch. Enough said. Not likely to give you RSI, but likely to get you killed by one of your
peers, this goes in the same category as open-back headphones.

## Cherry MX Green

(Sorry, unable to find a GIF for this.)

Hard-mode annoying clicky death switch. If you'd like to destroy everyone else's concentration _and_ cause lasting
muscular problems to yourself _at the same time_, this switch is the one for you.

# Side Note: Rubber Bands

![Rubber Bands and Things](/images/2015-10-31-mechanical-keyboard-switches/wasd-switch-tester.jpg)

As an aside: I also received the following with my [switch tester][switch-tester]:

 1. Red 40A-L Rubber O-Rings
 2. Blue 40A-R Rubber O-Rings

The basic purpose of these is to stop and resist key motion at a certain depth. If you'd like to limit your range of
motion for injury related reasons, these are great. The red rubber bands are weaker and thinner, while the blue ones
are thicker and provide more resistance.

I might use the blue rubber bands with some Cherry MX Brown switches because I've found that the blue rubber bands stop
motion _right after_ the tactile bump, meaning less range of motion and potentially less RSI.

# Final Remarks

Personally, I haven't yet found the mechanical keyboard for me. I'm still on my Apple Wireless Keyboard and loving it
but craving better resistance to accidental key-presses.

If I had to choose a switch type, however, I'd hands-down go with the Cherry MX Brown, possibly with some of those blue
40A-R rubber O-rings. I might opt to replace my <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> key with a Cherry MX Clear to prevent accidental
key-presses. The only usage I have for <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> is as a shortcut to change keyboard layouts:
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>CapsLock</kbd> here switches keyboard layouts between Dvorak and QWERTY.

And yes, I type in [Dvorak][dvorak].
