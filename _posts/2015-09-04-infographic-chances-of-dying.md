Ever wanted to know how likely it is to die for a given activity? Now you can.

Some interesting points of comparison:

 1. You are just about as likely to die while _swimming_ as when _running/jogging_.   
    That's a 0.000001% chance of dying, which is 10<sup>-6</sup>, versus a 99.999999% chance of living.
 1. Your likelihood of dying while skydiving is only a single order of magnitude greater than running/jogging and swimming.   
    That's a 0.00001% chance of dying, which is 10<sup>-5</sup>, versus a 99.99999% chance of living.
 1. It's 40% safer to ski than to run/jog or swim. 
 1. It's 64% safer to snowboard than to ski, which is surprising given snowboarding.
 1. You're _eighty-nine_ times more likely to die while hiking in the mountains than while skiing.
 1. It's an order of magnitude more dangerous to ride a bike than it is to swim.
 
Parents, if you're letting your children ride bikes, you should have no problem letting them swim
in lakes, provided that they do, in fact, know how to swim.

On a related note, I'm now interested in learning to skydive.
