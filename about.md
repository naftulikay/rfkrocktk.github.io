An urban mystic, pining for conifers in a jungle of concrete and steel.

### Contracting and Consulting

I periodically do consulting and contracting for organizations for a variety of reasons:

 * General software development and architecture recommendations and development for a given project.
 * Infrastructure planning for capacity and business growth in the cloud and in the local bare-metal datacenter. :metal:
 * Development, auditing, and testing of security-focused applications.
 * Fixing broken things that someone messed up.

I speak a number of programming and shell scripting languages, including but not limited to Java, Scala, C, C++, Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript (including ES2015), standard shell, and Bash. I'm working on learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), though time has been pretty tight as of late.
